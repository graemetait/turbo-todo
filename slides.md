# HTML over the wire
### An alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire.

This makes for fast first-load pages, keeps template rendering on the server, and allows for a simpler, more productive development experience in any programming language, without sacrificing any of the speed or responsiveness associated with a traditional single-page application.

# A brief history of web applications

### 2005 - 2015 - Rise of the backend ‘MVC’ frameworks
- Full pages of HTML generated and served by the server
- State managed in backend and communicated via URL query strings and HTML forms

---

# A brief history of web applications

### 2015 - ? - The SPA years
- Frontend frameworks the focus with HTML mostly generated in the browser
- State now managed in 2 places as frontend and backend are separate applications

---

# A brief history of web applications

### 2020 - ? - The all-in-one SPA frameworks
- Next.js, Remix, etc
- Encapsulates a lot of the SPA complexity to improve DX - complexity still there under the hood

---

# Downsides to the current

- JavaScript framework fatigue
- Overly complex codebase

---

# What's next?

- New breed of libraries attempting to simplify and get away from SPA
- Return to HTML generated by the server
- Single application and codebase

## Manage state and HTML in backend and update frontend ‘automatically’
- Phoenix LiveView, Laravel LiveWire
- Very nice developer experience
- Defining reactivity and letting the framework automatically update frontend templates when needed
- Some ‘magic’ as framework doing a lot of the work for you
- Largely ‘locked in’ to that model and framework

---

## Manage state and HTML in backend and update frontend manually, but without full page refresh
- Hotwire, htmx
- Very similar to building web applications 10+ years ago
- Requesting fragments of HTML from backend rather than full pages
- Can get similar results to an SPA
- Layer on interaction with JS, but not needed for requests and state management - often paired with lightweight frontend frameworks like Stimulus and Alpine.js

# htmx
Extends HTML to give it more powers
```html
  <button hx-get="/messages" hx-target="#messages-list" hx-swap="beforeend">
    Load messages
  </button>

  <div id="messages-list">
  </div>
```
HTML returned by `/messages`
```html
<p>My new message!</p>
```

---

# Turbo
Similar results to htmx, but driven by instructions in the returned HTML.
```html
  <a href="/messages">
    Load messages
  </a>

  <div id="messages-list">
  </div>
```
HTML returned by `/messages`
```html
<turbo-stream action="append" target="messages-list">
  <template>
    <p>My new message!</p>
  </template>
</turbo-stream>
```
